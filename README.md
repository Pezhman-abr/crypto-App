# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run the project, first install npm.
To install the main file that contains all the project files, type npm install in the terminal and let it install. 
Then you need to install two frameworks, rechart and react-loader-spiner
$ npm install recharts
$ npm i react-loader-spinner
After going through this process, you can start the project by typing npm run dev
